----Use Of ref---------
     1) It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track.
     2) Doesn’t trigger re-render when you change it which means even if the current value gets updated, It
        won't execute the whole component again.

--->
If you tried to implement this with a ref, React would never re-render the component, so you’d never see 
the count change! See how clicking this button does not update its text:

import { useRef } from 'react';
export default function Counter() {
  let countRef = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    // This doesn't re-render the component!
    countRef.current = countRef.current + 1;
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      You clicked {countRef.current} times
    </button>
  );
}

--> <input id="username" type="text" ref={userNameRef} />
--> <input id="age" type="number" ref={userAgeRef} />
