-----Use Of FRAGMENT-----------
If we have JXS return statement like below
    return (
        <h2>Hero</h2>
        <b>Hero</b>
    )
    It will throw error as It can have only one return TAG, so we have to surround with <div>
    The problem with <div> tag is some time we will end with a lots of nexted <div> tag.
    This will make slow execution of code as well.

    So with the help of <ReactFragment> JXS code </ReactFragment> , we can fix the above problem.
