what is basic React?
    main job: render UI and react to user Input
    in details, evaluate & Render JXS , Render UI , Manage State & props, React to (User) events & input,
    Re-evalutae component & props upon state changes.

    The above are basic of react.

SIDE EFFECT:
    anything else apart from above known as SIDE EFFECT.
    e.g : calling https, storing data in browser , amange timers EFFECT
    So the above task must executed outside of the normal component execution

Therefore we have introduce useEffect to handle sideEffect in React.
we have 
    useEffect(()=>{},[dependencies]), Here function will get executed while executing component 
    only if specified dependencies will be changed.

    If if the page is reload, useEffect will kept the store data.

Real Life scenarios:
    user shouldn't logged out after refreshing the page, TODO this we will use browser memory to store falg value.
    and flag value will get changed only after certain condition not by eevery execution of components.

We might be ending with creating infinite loop while using useEffect.


localStorage is global variable which can be use to set the value at browser storage.
[]-> this condition inside useEffect() means , the method will be executed after each loading.
        So even we refresh the page, It will execute.


----Debouncing------------

This is a techneque by which we can stop the execution of method inside useEffect().
    we can stop by mentioning time (if user stop typing for 500ms) /no of character(after 20 char, It wil 
    execute the method).
    We can use setTimeout() for this.

----------------
  // useEffect(() => {
  //   const identifier = setTimeout(() => {
  //     console.log('Checking form validity!');
  //     setFormIsValid(
  //       enteredEmail.includes('@') && enteredPassword.trim().length > 6
  //     );
  //   }, 500);

  //   return () => {
  //     console.log('CLEANUP');
  //     clearTimeout(identifier);
  //   };
  // }, [enteredEmail, enteredPassword]);
