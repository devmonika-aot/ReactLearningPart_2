-------------REDUX-----------------
Types of state:
    LocalState : State that belong to single Component. ( useState/useReducer can be used)
    Cross-Component State : State that affect multiple Component. (props chain)
    app-wide: state that affects the entire app.( this can be done using props chain as well)
     
So, to handle Cross-Componnet and app wide state, we can use either (React Context/Redux).

Why Redux?
State transfer between components is pretty messy in React since it is hard to keep track of which component the 
data is coming from. It becomes really complicated if users are working with a large number of states within an
application.
            Redux solves the state transfer problem by storing all of the states in a single place called a store.
Every component in the application can then directly access the required state from that store

---------------------------Working Principle Of Redux---------------

Centrail Data Store : This is the place where shared data between Componnets.

1) All the components which uses shared data i.e store data, they subscribe to shared STORE.
2) When there will be any change in the data, the corresponding component which is subscribe to the data will be informed.
3) To update data, Components doesn't update STORE directly, It uses Reducer function to updated data.
4) Component dispatch request to reducer by passing action, action is nothing but the task which need to perform 
   inside reducer.
5) Once reducer update data in store, it informs the subscibe component.

------------------------------------------
Since Redux is java script library and there is no realtionship between react and reduxSo,
we have to install third party library
npm install redux react-redux
