We have added Provider component in index.js file i.e parent node to make store is available for app.js 
and child component of app.js

--------execution process---------
When we are clicking on increment/decrement button, It is executing dispatch method which is calling reducer method
Once the value inside store changes, It executes Counter component as useSelector subscribe it automatically.
-----------------------------------
Problem with redux:
    If we have more complex data or number of values inside store is huge then since we have to override previous
    state with all the data, it will be very complex and same peice of data we may have to write a lot of time.
    eg:
        return { 
            counter: state.counter - 1 ,
             showCounter : state.showCounter,
             abc,
             xyz
             pqr 
             etc
             };
-----------------------------------
SO we have redux-toolkit third party library we can use to solve the above problem, It 
also makes redux easy and simple.
