-----------Redux-Toolkit-----------
To resolve the redux issue stated in Theory2.txt, we came across Slice.

Ideally we should have only one reducer component.
We create slice of global state, global state is nothing state for component.
lets say we may have auth a global state for Authentication componnet here we have counter state for Counter component


//reducer is nothing but all the method slice needs to update data for the corresponding componnet
