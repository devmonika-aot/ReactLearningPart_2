What is Component?
	Reuseable building block which can consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
	Separation of concerm         
	A component in react is just java script function, A special kind of function which return JSX code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  - It also split Big chunk of code into  multiple smaller functions
	
React Execution :
	When we run the react application, first index.js will execute. 
	
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));  
	This is nothing but it is calling HTML element which has id as root. Once It call, It will print HTML element.
	as it is rendering app.js, so HTML element with id as root will get replaced by App.js

Below are the two React library which we will use to create React project.	
	"react": "^18.0.0",
	"react-dom": "^18.0.0"

index.html :
	This is the only HTML file which is used by React ( because of this , we call react as Single Page application )
	and It is present in PUBLIC folder.
	It will get loaded while executing ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); 
JXS : 
	In React we write code in JXS format wwhich is developer friendly but this JXS is not supported by 
	any browser and because of this only when we see the source code, It completely differnet then the 
	actual code code

Calling Component :
	1) <ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>
	2) <ExpenseItem/>
	Above , both are correct If we have to send any data as argument then we can use 1st approach and if we just
	have to call any component then we can go with 2nd approach.
About Index.js:
	We genrally call only root element from this file which is app.js to make App as Root component

Adding Styling ( CSS ) file:
	import './ExpenseItem.css';
	Note : In order to call a class in css file, we have to use className instead of class we do in HTML.

Adding Dynamic Data in JSX:
	const expenseTitle = "Car Insurance";
	<h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>

Foramt in VSStudio:
	shift+alt+f

Children props:
	eg Card.js component
	When we have to design generic kind of template which can be used across the Components,
	we can create Children props.

Difference between <Card> xyz </Card> and <h2> xyz </h2>.
	<h2> xyz </h2> : If we use content between HTML tags, It will work but when we use content between Custom component
	eg. <Card> xyz </Card>, then we have use use concept of children props in order to work.
	for example :
		<div className='card'>{props.children}</div>

How className work in Custom Component?
	const classes = 'card ' + props.className;
	<div className={classes}>{props.children}</div>
