*****Passing list bw Component and based on some condition*****
        NewExpense, ExpenseForm, App.js file

        {expenses.map((expense) => (
        <ExpenseItem
          key = {expense.id}
          date={expense.date}
          title={expense.title}
          price={expense.price}
        />
    In the above example, we are rendering list with Component.
    Make sure after => you use() not {}

    NOTE: It is important to provide key as It will tell react order sequence of list.


***********Conditional Content*******
  Rendering different output under different condition
  i.e based on some condition, we will call the component

  Method - 1:
      {filteredExpenses.length === 0 ? (
        <p>The List is empty</p>
      ) : (
        filteredExpenses.map((expense) => (
          <ExpenseItem
            key={expense.id}
            date={expense.date}
            title={expense.title}
            price={expense.amount}
          />
        ))
      )}
  Method - 2: Here , If the condition is true then after && will execute
       {filteredExpenses.length === 0 && <p>The List is empty</p>}
       {filteredExpenses.length > 0 &&
        filteredExpenses.map((expense) => (
          <ExpenseItem
            key={expense.id}
            date={expense.date}
            title={expense.title}
            price={expense.amount}
          />
        ))}
  Method - 3:
      let expenseContent = <p>The List is empty</p>;
      if (filteredExpenses.length > 0) {
        expenseContent =
          filteredExpenses.length > 0 &&
          filteredExpenses.map((expense) => (
            <ExpenseItem
              key={expense.id}
              date={expense.date}
              title={expense.title}
              price={expense.amount}
            />
          ));
      }

      then pass as 
      return (
        <div>
          {expenseContent}
        </div>
      );
